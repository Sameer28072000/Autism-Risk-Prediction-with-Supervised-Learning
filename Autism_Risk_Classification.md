# 🧠 Autism_Risk_Classification

Built a model to predict autism risk using behavioral and demographic data for early screening support.

## 🗃️ Dataset
800+ labeled records of children and adults.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Can we build a reliable model to support early autism risk detection?

## ✅ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, GridSearchCV

## 🔍 Insights
- Family history strongest predictor
- SVM & RF delivered similar results
- Cross-validation ensured generalization
- GridSearchCV improved tuning efficiency

## 📈 Results
- 82% accuracy, 80% precision, 78% recall
- 30% tuning time saved

## 💡 Conclusion
Deployed model ready for screening scenarios. Can be adapted into pre-diagnostic systems.
